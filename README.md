# Network-Topology-Design
<h1>Harry Potter Hogwarts Network Topology</h1>

Project Desc:
Designed and implemented a multi-segmented enterprise network topology using PacketTracer. The project featured logical segmentation (e.g., departments like "Hogwarts," "Ministry," etc.), inter-router communication, and IP routing to emulate real-world infrastructure. This design emphasized network security best practices, including segmentation for threat containment, routing path control, and monitoring-ready architecture. Demonstrated practical skills in secure network design, traffic flow analysis, and foundational cybersecurity principles such as Zero Trust and resilience against lateral movement.

Key Features & Cybersecurity Benefits:
Network Segmentation: Each subnet was isolated using routing protocols and switch configurations to enforce access control and reduce attack surfaces, supporting Zero Trust principles.

Routing & Interconnectivity: Designed and implemented dynamic/static routing between segments. Demonstrated understanding of secure routing protocols and IP path control.

Traffic Flow & Access Control: Identified optimal points for placing firewalls, IDS/IPS, and access control devices to monitor and restrict unauthorized traffic between departments.

High-Density User Simulation: Modeled environments like classrooms or open labs with 20+ end-user devices to simulate real-world usage and threat exposure.

Redundancy & Fault Tolerance: Core infrastructure included centralized routing with alternate paths considered for maintaining uptime and ensuring business continuity in the event of network failure.

Cybersecurity Readiness: The entire topology was built with security-first logic, ready for integration with packet inspection tools, honeypots, and logging systems for incident response.

Cybersecurity Skills Demonstrated:
- Secure network design and architecture
- Subnetting and IP address planning
- Access control and inter-VLAN routing
- Network traffic flow analysis and segmentation
- Infrastructure planning with defense-in-depth in mind

Outcome
This project reflects practical knowledge of how to build a secure and resilient enterprise network from the ground up. It prepares for real-world cybersecurity tasks such as incident response, threat containment, vulnerability isolation, and infrastructure hardening.
